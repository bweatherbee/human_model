# human_model
This repository contains code associated with the analysis of 10x multiome data for the generation of a multilineage stem cell-derived model of the post-implantation human embryo.

Code was run on a Windows Machine. R scripts were run in RStudio with plots saved via the IDE. Python scripts were run using JupyterLab on a windows subsystem for Linux in Ubuntu.
